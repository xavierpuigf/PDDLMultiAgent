# PDDLMultiAgent
PDDL Definition for tasks in VirtualHome

To find a plan for the `example_problem.pddl` run
```python planner.py domain.pddl example_problem.pddl out```
Use this API to solve the PDDL http://planning.domains/


You can also find a plan (for set up a table) using a real environment. Generate the pddl with

```
python env_parser.py
```

And then solve it using
```
python planner.py domain.pddl example_out.pddl 
```
